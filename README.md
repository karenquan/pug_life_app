# Pug Life

Pug Life is for pug lovers! Anyone who visits the site will be able to browse photos of pugs that other users have added. But, as a registered user, you will have the opportunity to add your own photos, and they will appear on your own personal profile page. You can even add other people's photos to your "Favorites" list. :)
